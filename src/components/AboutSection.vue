              My name is Aleks Jović, I am based in Buzet, Croatia, and I have over 10 years of experience in IT development, working across enterprise systems, integrations, and complex business solutions.

              I am currently employed as a Senior Salesforce Developer at <a href="https://www.hsm360.com/hr/" target="_blank" class="transition-colors duration-200 text-brand-primary hover:text-brand-accent">HSM Informatika</a>, where I design and implement scalable Salesforce solutions, develop custom functionalities, and collaborate closely with business stakeholders to translate requirements into reliable technical architectures. 
              In addition to hands-on development, I serve as a Development Team Lead, coordinating technical delivery, mentoring developers, and ensuring best practices in code quality and system design.
            </p>

            <p>
              Outside of technology, I play guitar, compete in handball as a goalkeeper for RK Buzet, and enjoy pub quizzes as a fun way to unwind and stay curious.
